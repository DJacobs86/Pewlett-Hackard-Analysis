# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Using SQL- relational databases

# Purpose of our project

The purpose of our project is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to to participate in the mentorship program. Our retiring employees by title information will show the titles of all employees born between January, 1 1952 and December, 31 1955. First we created a query that retrieved the emp_no, first_name and last_name columns from the employees table and retrieved the title,from_date and to_date columns of the titles table in our pewlett-hackard query. We joined both of these table on the primary key,filtered the data by birth_date and put the information into a new table.
